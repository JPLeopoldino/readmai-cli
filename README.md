# readmai

This project is a Python package named `readmai`, structured using `pyproject.toml` for build configuration and dependency management. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) implemented in `src/readmai/cli.py`.

## Installation

The project utilizes `pyproject.toml` for build configuration, suggesting a modern build system like `pip` or `poetry`. To install:

**Using pip:**

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    Alternatively, you can install the project along with its dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt .
    ```

**Using poetry:**

1.  Ensure you have Poetry installed (`pip install poetry`).
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Usage

The project provides a command-line interface. After installation, you should be able to access the `readmai` command.

To use the `readmai` command, run:

```bash
readmai --help #or similar; edit based on what readmai's actual CLI help shows.
```

This will display the available commands and options. Refer to the output of `--help` or explore the `src/readmai/cli.py` file to understand the specific functionalities and arguments of the `readmai` command.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
readmai/
├── requirements.txt
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── src/
    └── readmai/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── cli.py
    └── readmai.egg-info/
        ├── PKG-INFO
        ├── SOURCES.txt
        ├── entry_points.txt
        ├── top_level.txt
        └── dependency_links.txt
```

*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's Python dependencies.
*   `pyproject.toml`: Specifies build system requirements and project metadata (e.g., dependencies, version).
*   `src/readmai/__init__.py`: Marks the `readmai` directory as a Python package.
*   `src/readmai/cli.py`: Contains the implementation of the command-line interface.
*   `src/readmai.egg-info/`: Contains metadata generated during the installation process. This directory is automatically created by `setuptools`. `entry_points.txt` likely defines how `readmai` gets exposed to the command line.
